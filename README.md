## Project description  

Space War is a science fiction video game that tells the story of an alien invasion of planet Earth. It all begins when a strange signal reaches Earth from deep space. Scientists cannot determine its origin, but they know it is an intelligent signal. After a few years of investigation, it is discovered that the signal comes from a planet called Zorg.

Earth scientists decide to send a ship to investigate the origin of the signal. But when the ship arrives at Zorg, it is attacked by a fleet of alien ships. The Earth ship manages to escape and returns to Earth to report what has happened.

The world leaders decide that it is necessary to prepare for a possible invasion and begin to build spaceships to defend the planet. The war begins when the alien ships arrive on Earth and start attacking the main cities.

The humans fight bravely, but the alien ships are superior in technology and combat strategy. The humans suffer heavy losses, but do not give up. In an effort to turn the war around, the humans send a group of highly trained pilots on a mission to destroy the aliens' main base.

The mission is dangerous and many of the pilots do not return, but they manage to destroy the main base and disable the aliens' defensive shield. The humans seize the opportunity and launch a massive attack that finally manages to repel the aliens.

The war ends in victory for the humans, but at great cost. Major cities around the world have been destroyed and millions of people have died in the fighting. The humans begin to rebuild and prepare for a possible invasion in the future, while the aliens return to their planet with the promise that they will return someday to finish what they started.

Eliminate the last remaining troops on earth!.
